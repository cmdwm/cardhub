Simple but good looking GitHub stat cards.

## How to Use

To use CardHub, clone this repository and it should be 100% ready to use!

The `user` query is where your username goes. For the `bio` query, you can choose from yes or no. This will toggle if your profile bio is shown or not.

## Examples

HTML Example:

```html
<a href="https://github.com/whasonyt">
  <img src="https://example.com/info?user=whasonyt&bio=yes" />
</a>
```

Markdown Example:

```md
[![GitHub](https://example.com/info?user=whasonyt&bio=no)](https://github.com/whasonyt)
```

### Final Result (without bio)
